# Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to apply a Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn on the classic Iris flower dataset. It includes model training, visualization of the decision tree, and performance evaluation.

 ## Files

- `Decision_Tree_on_Iris_Dataset_.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow.
- No external dataset file required â€” the Iris dataset is loaded directly via `sklearn.datasets`.

##  Features

- Loads the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
- Visualizes the decision tree using `plot_tree`
- Evaluates model using classification report and accuracy

##  Requirements

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
